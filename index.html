<h3> Computer Scientist: </h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">

I am currently completing an M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison (est. Winter 2022). 
  My main areas of interest are in Machine Learning/Artificial Intellegence and Data Science/Big Data. 
If you are interested in the course work that I have completed please check out my

As an example of such crousework, for my Data Visualization class I created a tool: 
<a href="https://github.com/MTabbutt/SubGroupExplorerTool_DataViz_CS765" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sub Group Explorer Tool</a>
in an effort to address a very common issue in the data science community currently, which is finding interesting sub groups within a large dataset. 
It takes as input a dataset and outputs multivariate visualizations of sub groups. The tool can be used in an 
exploritory manner to look at the statistical distributions and correlation between data, as well as a visualization
tool once the interesting relationships have been determined. Alternatively, if you have specific data that you want
to anazlyze from the onset, you can skip the exploritory phase. Shown below is an example of one such multi-variate sub group visualiztion:
