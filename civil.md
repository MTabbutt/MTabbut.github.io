### Improving Bus Route Design Using Stop Balancing and Community-level Data <br/>
J. McKetney, E. Trujillo, **M. Tabbutt**, B. Baur &nbsp; [doi.org/10.38126/JSPG180109](https://doi.org/10.38126/JSPG180109)

One of the most interesting and important results from the paper was the analysis of the distrubution of bus resources taking into consideration the discrepencies in departure time for work accross race as well as the distribution of races across Madison, WI. In the first figure below it is clear that while most people depart for work around 7am, however there is a large descrepency in departure times based on race. Furthermore, the bus routes that are run by Madison Metro Transit change throughout the day, as can be seen in the second figure.

The Capital Times writes an article about Data Science in Madison with Tyler Caraza-Harter! <br/>

### ‘Data Science in Madison’ class offers UW students ‘real world’ projects <br/>

Abigail Becker &#124; The Capital Times &#124; Feb 15, 2021 &#124; [data-science-in-madison](https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/data-science-in-madison-class-offers-uw-students-real-world-projects/article_9e5db95e-192c-5747-bd3a-a467d2228c30.html)

Preview:

- “In the classroom we’re giving people data and often the data is clean and easy to work with,” Caraza-Harter said. “Whenever you start working with real data, you find they’re messy.” Students learn how to work with imperfect data and still extract meaningful conclusions. 
- Megan Tabbutt, 28, recommended changes to city bus routes to maximize the benefits of the future Bus Rapid Transit project while minimizing cost and increasing accessibility. Now, Tabbutt is expanding on this topic through research with Catalysts for Science Policy, a group on campus for graduate and postdoctoral students interested in science policy. Tabbutt said the class and paper writing process, in addition to the protests over racial injustice this summer, emphasized the importance of acknowledging where assumptions fail. “You’re trying to redo the bus route,” Tabbutt continued. “It’s hard not to re-optimize for you.”
