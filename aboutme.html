<em> 
  
  I am currently finishing my Computer Science Masters with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Science. 
  I am also working on finishing my Physics Ph.D. in Observational Cosmology with the Dark Energy Survey. We are working on making the 
  most precise measurements of dark energy to date and to exploring the expansion history of the universe! One of my favorite topics to think about is
  systematics mitigation, honestly!

Outside of academia I love to hang out with my husband and our two twin ginger tabby cats. We love to hike, cook and bake together, and play board games. 
I also spent many years training in martial arts. I have 4 black belts in Tae Kwon Do, and travelled around competing nationally before college! More 
recently I have trained in MMA, Muay Thai, and Jiu-Jitsu!
