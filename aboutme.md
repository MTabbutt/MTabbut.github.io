### Improving Bus Route Design Using Stop Balancing and Community-level Data <br/>
J. McKetney, E. Trujillo, **M. Tabbutt**, B. Baur &nbsp; [doi.org/10.38126/JSPG180109](https://doi.org/10.38126/JSPG180109)

One of the most interesting and important results from the paper was the analysis of the discrepencies in departure time for work based on race. Seen below is a figure that I made from data obtained from the 2010 US Census for Wisconsin. While most people leave for work at 7am, the distribution of "non 9-5" shifts are skewed to non-white races disporpotionatly from what you would expect based on the race distribution of the state. This skew should be considered when analyzing bus routes for cities as lower off-peak service can affect races differently.
